This is a simple and clean TO-DO List web app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them when done. The design is minimal and mobile-friendly, with a centered white box that gives a neat user interface. When a task is completed, it's shown with a strike-through effect. The app helps organize daily tasks efficiently. It was developed as part of an internship project to demonstrate basic front-end development skills and improve productivity. This project is beginner-friendly and great for learning DOM manipulation in JavaScript.
